#
# THE PIN, AUDITED BY CONTENT.
#
# release.yml pins the shared release guards by commit SHA, and the
# question that pin is supposed to answer is "which bytes will run".
# Until .github/guard-pins.sha256 existed, that question was answered by
# a value the platform handed the guards rather than by anything
# observable about the files: the guards read a revision from the job
# context and then checked that `actions/checkout` had fetched that same
# revision, which is one number compared with itself. Two revisions that
# are byte-identical are indistinguishable by such a check, and two that
# are NOT identical are exactly the case that must be caught.
#
# So .github/guard-pins.sha256 records the digest of every guard file at
# the revision this repository audited, and this test re-fetches each one
# and compares. A pin bumped without re-auditing goes red on the revision
# line; a pin whose bytes are not the audited bytes goes red on a digest.
# Neither outcome depends on anything the guards say about themselves.
#
# Run it directly:
#
#   bash tests/test_guard_pins.sh
#
# `capa test` runs the .capa files in tests/ and ignores this one.
#
# It reports SKIP rather than failing when `gh` is missing or
# unauthenticated, matching tests/test_release_wiring.sh: an offline
# machine cannot fetch the canonical bytes, and a test that guesses at
# them is the failure mode this file is about. The pin itself is still
# checked offline, because a malformed pin means there is no canonical
# revision to compare against and that is knowable without the network.
#
# CONTROL FLOW, deliberately: FAIL FAST ON PRECONDITIONS, EXHAUSTIVE ON
# SUBSTANCE. A missing workflow, a malformed pin, a missing record, an
# absent revision or a revision that is not the pinned one each end the
# run, because every assertion after them would be comparing against
# nothing and would report a shape of failure that hides the cause. Once
# the revision is settled, every file is checked and every mismatch is
# reported, because "which of them drifted" is the answer worth having.
# capa_authgate's ancestor of this file kept going after a revision
# mismatch instead; that was measured and yields no extra diagnostic on
# any reachable path, since it skips the digest loop in that state too.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO LOCAL COPY OF ANY GUARD, and why capa_authgate's
# tools/check_tag_version.sh was deleted rather than copied out here.
# That file existed so the guard could be rehearsed offline, and it was
# a second copy of a security control inside the very fleet whose drift
# apparatus exists because copies drift. Its own header recorded that it
# had ALREADY drifted once, having been forked before the shared guard
# gained its third argument, so the two accepted different arguments and
# printed different messages while looking interchangeable. The guard is
# now tested once, in the compiler repository, against the file the
# release actually runs. The acknowledged cost is that a contributor
# with only an adopter checked out can no longer rehearse that guard
# offline; that was weighed and accepted, because a rehearsable copy
# that lies is worse than a canonical one that is out of reach.
#
# THIS FILE HAS NO REPO-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION and is copied verbatim
# into every adopter. That is not left as an assertion: it is a
# WHOLE-FILE entry in .github/shared-regions.sha256, so
# tests/test_shared_regions.sh digests all of it and layer 2 compares
# that digest against the canonical copy upstream. Having no config
# region is the point rather than an omission; the config region is the
# only part of a shared file that nothing digests, so a file that needs
# none should have none.
