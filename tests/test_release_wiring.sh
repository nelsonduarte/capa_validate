# Regression test for how .github/workflows/release.yml CALLS the shared
# release guards, and for whether what it calls them with covers this
# package.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The guards themselves are tested where they live, in
# the compiler repository. What is NOT tested there, and cannot be, is
# whether a consumer wired them up in a way that actually gates
# anything. A `guards:` job that runs and reports failure while the
# release publishes anyway is worse than no guard at all: it produces a
# green-looking gate, a red job nobody reads, and a published artefact.
# That is the same shape as the defects the guards exist to catch,
# verification that proves nothing about the thing it appears to cover.
#
# The wiring can break in ways that no YAML parser and no linter calls
# an error, because every one of them is a VALID workflow:
#
#   * pinning a tag or a branch instead of a commit, so the guard can be
#     edited under us;
#   * pinning a well-formed SHA that does not exist, so every release
#     fails at dispatch, or worse, resolves to something unintended;
#   * dropping `needs: guards`, so the two jobs race and the release can
#     publish before the guards finish;
#   * `continue-on-error` or a job-level `if: always()`, so the guards
#     run, fail, and block nothing;
#   * naming a module in the flow that does not exist, so the step is a
#     no-op that nothing notices;
#   * leaving a module out of the flow entirely, so it is never checked
#     and the log looks complete.
#
# Run it directly:
#
#   bash tests/test_release_wiring.sh
#
# `capa test` runs the .capa files in tests/ and ignores this one.
#
# Deliberately grep and awk based: it needs nothing installed and runs
# anywhere the release runs. The one check that needs the network (does
# the pinned commit exist, and does it carry the workflow file) reports
# SKIP rather than failing when `gh` is unavailable or unauthenticated,
# because an offline machine cannot answer that question and a test that
# guesses is the failure mode this whole file is about.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT `--check-capabilities` ACTUALLY COVERS, because the answer is not
# what this repository used to claim and the claim is what made the
# mistake likely.
#
# It covers the IMPORT CLOSURE OF THE ENTRY POINT IT IS GIVEN. It does
# not cover "the package". A module that is not an entry point and is
# not imported, directly or transitively, by an entry point is never
# opened, and the command exits 0 having never seen it. Measured on the
# released 1.18.1 against the published capa_hex v0.2.0 tarball with an
# `Fs`-taking `extra.capa` added at the top level:
#
#   capa --check-capabilities hex.capa      -> exit 0, "OK"
#   capa --check-capabilities example.capa  -> exit 0, "OK"
#   capa --check-capabilities extra.capa    -> exit 1, introduces 'Fs'
#
# So the ceiling is only as wide as the set of entry points the release
# hands it, and a package whose release checks two of its five top-level
# modules has a ceiling over two of its five top-level modules.
#
# THIS FILE CLOSES THAT LOOP AGAINST THE FILESYSTEM. It reads the
# top-level `*.capa` files off disk and requires the config below to
# account for every one of them: checked, checked-as-a-negative, or
# explicitly declared unchecked WITH A REASON. Adding a module to the
# repository and forgetting the flow is then a red test rather than a
# silent hole.
#
# WHY TOTAL COVERAGE RATHER THAN CLOSURE ANALYSIS. The alternative was
# to parse the `import` lines and prove each module lies inside some
# entry point's closure. That was rejected: it re-implements the
# compiler's module resolver in shell, and when the two drift, the shell
# version reports "covered" for a module that is not, which is the
# UNSAFE direction and precisely the class of defect this file exists to
# abolish. Requiring every module to be an entry point costs one line
# per module in the consumer flow and a few seconds of clean-room time,
# and it is strictly stronger: it proves each module stays under the
# ceiling IN ISOLATION, so a later refactor that drops a module out of
# the closure does not silently drop its check with it.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS FILE IS MEANT TO BE SHARED ACROSS REPOSITORIES.
#
# It was derived from capa_authgate's copy, which hardcoded that
# repository's own shape: `main.capa`, `service.capa` and
# `tools/nest_vendor.py`. Copied verbatim into any other package those
# three assertions are false, and the nest_vendor one is false in EVERY
# other repository in the fleet, because no other package has a
# two-level dependency graph. A shared test whose assertions have to be
# edited per repository is a shared test that will be edited wrongly.
#
# So everything repo-specific has been lifted into the CONFIG block
# below and everything under it is intended to be byte-identical
# everywhere. Adopting this file in a new package means editing the
# config block and nothing else. If you find yourself editing below the
# line, that is a signal the config block is missing a dimension, and
# the fix is to add one rather than to fork the body.
#
# ADOPTION CHECKLIST. In order, and none of the steps are optional:
#
#   1. Run, from a checkout of the compiler repository,
#      `bash fleet/adopt.sh <this repository> <compiler revision>`.
#      That installs this file, the mutation test, the two zero-config
#      checks and the checks.yml workflow, and writes
#      .github/shared-regions.sha256 from that revision. Do not copy any
#      of them by hand.
#   1a. Copy .github/workflows/{release,guard-selftest}.yml from an
#      existing adopter and adapt their consumer flow to this package.
#      There is no template for these two because they are genuinely
#      repo-specific; this file checks the adaptation in detail, which is
#      what makes copying them safe.
#   1b. Run `bash fleet/guard_pins.sh <this repository>` to write
#      .github/guard-pins.sha256 from the revision release.yml pins, then
#      READ the guard files and replace the audit note it leaves blank.
#      DO NOT COPY THAT FILE FROM ANOTHER ADOPTER. A copied one passes
#      every check while having audited nothing, because its digests
#      genuinely are the pinned revision's bytes. It used to be the only
#      way to obtain one, and the copy then asserted in its new
#      repository that a human had recomputed and read everything.
#   2. Edit ONLY the CONFIG block below. Run
#      `bash tests/test_release_wiring.sh` and fix what it reddens; the
#      body will tell you about every top-level module you have not
#      accounted for.
#   3. Make the consumer flow in BOTH workflows match the config. They
#      are compared to each other, so edit them together.
#   4. Set `capa = ">=..."` in capa.toml to at least the fleet floor
#      asserted below. Do NOT re-measure it per repository: the floor is
#      analytically derivable and the body enforces it.
#   5. DISPATCH guard-selftest.yml AGAINST THE PREVIOUS TAG BEFORE YOU
#      TAG ANYTHING. This is the step people skip and it is the one that
#      pays. Everything in this file is a STATIC check of the wiring; it
#      cannot run a compiler, so it cannot tell you that the declared
#      floor is false, that a vendored dependency is missing from the
#      manifest, or that a documented command does not work in a
#      directory with no siblings. Only the clean room can, and the
#      self-test is the clean room without the cost of a tag. A green
#      run of this file on a repository still declaring a false floor is
#      exactly what an adoption looks like the moment before it burns a
#      tag.
#   6. Only then push the signed tag.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

set -uo pipefail

# ================== CONFIG: the only repo-specific part ==================

# EVERY VALUE BELOW IS A PLACEHOLDER. Replace all six, then run
# `bash tests/test_release_wiring.sh` and fix what it reddens.
#
# THIS BLOCK IS THE ONLY PART OF THIS FILE THAT IS NOT DIGESTED, so it is
# also the only part an adopter may touch. tests/test_shared_regions.sh
# digests everything outside it and refuses any difference from the
# canonical template, and it additionally requires this block to consist
# of nothing but blank lines, comments and one single-line assignment to
# each of the six names below. That second rule is not tidiness: an
# un-digested region accepts arbitrary shell, and a single line reading
# `trap 'exit 0' EXIT` placed here makes this whole file exit 0 while
# still printing its failures, which is a green CI run over a release
# gate that is no longer there.

# Entry points the clean room must COMPILE, in the order the flow runs
# them. For a library this is the library module plus any documented
# runnable example; for an application it is each executable entry.
ENTRY_POINTS=(validate.capa example.capa)

# Entry points whose CAPABILITY CEILING the clean room must check.
#
# Because the ceiling covers only the import closure of the entry it is
# given (see the note above), this list must account for EVERY top-level
# `.capa` file in the repository, together with the three lists that
# follow it. The body reads the directory and refuses any module that
# appears in none of them.
#
# Leave this EMPTY for a package that declares no `[capabilities]` table
# in capa.toml, and the body below will then require that the flow does
# NOT run `--check-capabilities` at all. That is not pedantry: with no
# ceiling declared the command prints
#
#   capa: --check-capabilities: no package declares a [capabilities]
#         ceiling; nothing to verify.
#
# and exits 0. A step that always passes having inspected nothing is
# precisely the class of defect the release guards exist to abolish, and
# it is worse than omitting the step, because the log looks like
# evidence. The body cross-checks this list against capa.toml so the two
# cannot disagree.
CEILING_ENTRIES=(validate.capa example.capa)

# Modules the clean room must prove the CEILING REFUSES.
#
# A repository that documents "this file is what the ceiling catches"
# is making a claim about the compiler, and an undemonstrated claim
# about a security control is the thing this whole pilot keeps finding.
# Each entry here obliges the consumer flow to carry a line that runs
# the check and requires it to fail FOR THE STATED REASON, so a module
# that starts passing (or that stops existing) reddens the release.
NEGATIVE_CEILING_ENTRIES=()

# Modules the clean room must prove the COMPILER REFUSES, as
# `file.capa=substring of the expected error`. The substring is
# mandatory: a bare "it failed" passes for a missing file, a syntax
# error, or any other reason, and a negative that passes for the wrong
# reason is not a negative.
COMPILER_REJECTS=()

# Top-level modules deliberately left out of the release checks, as
# `file.capa=why`. The reason is mandatory and is the whole point: this
# is the one place a module can be uncovered, and it costs a written
# justification that a reviewer reads.
UNCHECKED_MODULES=()

# Does the consumer flow need `python tools/nest_vendor.py`?
#
# Only for a package with a TWO-LEVEL dependency graph: the ceiling gate
# looks for a dependency's own dependencies under `vendor/<dep>/vendor/`
# while `capa install` vendors flat. At the time of writing exactly one
# repository in the fleet needs it (capa_authgate). Set to "yes" there
# and "no" everywhere else; when it is "no" the body REQUIRES the line
# to be absent, so a copy-paste of someone else's flow is caught rather
# than silently carried along.

# THE FLEET COMPILER FLOOR. Deliberately below the config line, because
# it is NOT a per-repository measurement and an adopter must not be able
# to lower it by editing a config block.
#
# It is analytically derivable rather than measured per package. capa
# 1.18.0 (PR #85) changed the module resolver so `[package].name` maps
# to the project root. Every seed library self-imports
# `capa_<name>.<module>` while its tarball extracts to
# `capa_<name>-v<tag>`, so on every release below 1.18.0 that
# self-import resolves to nothing and the package does not build at all.
# 1.18.1 is then the first release whose binary can run `capa test`,
# which every consumer flow does. That gives >=1.18.1 uniformly, and it
# was confirmed 3 for 3 against the released binaries on capa_base64,
# capa_url and capa_uuid.
#
# WHY THIS ASSERTION EARNS ITS PLACE. An adoption performed exactly as
# the checklist above instructs produced 52 green assertions on a
# repository still declaring `capa = ">=1.1.0"`, a floor that is not
# merely untested but FALSE: that compiler cannot build the package at
# all. Nothing static caught it, and the clean room only speaks at tag
# time, so the defect the pilot existed to find survived a by-the-book
# adoption and would have cost a tag to discover.
#
# Over-declaring is a usability cost and under-declaring is a soundness
# one, so this is a floor and not an equality: a package may declare
# HIGHER (capa_authgate needs Serve, which shipped in 1.17.0) and never
# lower.

# --- searching captured text WITHOUT a pipeline -------------------------
#
# NOTHING BELOW MAY WRITE A CAPTURED BLOCK INTO A PIPELINE WHOSE READER
# CAN STOP EARLY. `pipefail` is set above, and `grep -q` exits at its
# FIRST match while the producer is still writing, so the producer dies
# of SIGPIPE and the PIPELINE reports 141 on a search that SUCCEEDED.
# `head`, `grep -m` and anything else that closes its input do the same.
#
# That made the answer depend on how much text FOLLOWS the match, and
# on the machine. `printf` writes in buffer-sized chunks, and only a
# chunk issued AFTER the reader has gone takes the signal, so a block
# that fits in one write was always answered correctly and a longer one
# was a race the producer usually but not always won. The buffer is
# about 4 KiB where stdio sizes it from a pipe's st_blksize, which is
# the Linux runners, and the pipe's own 64 KiB capacity where the shell
# buffers more, which is MSYS. Measured on a valid manifest the
# `[capabilities]` check failed 7 runs in 15; with 200 comment lines
# added after `max` it failed 10 out of 10; past 64 KiB of tail it fails
# 20 out of 20 everywhere, because no producer can finish a write that
# large after the reader has exited.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS WERE WRONG, and the negated one was the dangerous one.
# `printf ... | grep -q X` reporting 141 turns a genuine match into a
# failed check, which is noise; `! printf ... | grep -q X` turns 141
# into SUCCESS, so `continue-on-error` sitting early in a long job block
# was reported as absent. A release gate that had been switched off read
# as green, which is the exact class of defect this file exists to
# catch.
#
# A here-string is a redirection and not a pipeline, so there is no
# producer to kill, no `pipefail` to trip and no dependence on the
# length of the input. The empty case is unchanged: `printf "%s" ""`
# offers grep zero lines and `<<< ""` offers one empty line, and no
