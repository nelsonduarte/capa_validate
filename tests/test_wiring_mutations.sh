# Mutation test for tests/test_release_wiring.sh and, from S onwards,
# for tests/test_shared_regions.sh.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The wiring test reports "53 passed, 0 failed", and
# that number says how many assertions RAN. It says nothing about how
# many of them BITE. An adversarial audit of this repository applied
# three edits by hand, each of which leaves a release checking less than
# it claims, and all three passed green:
#
#   * an entry point typo'd identically in the config and in the flow,
#     so both agree about a file that does not exist;
#   * a ceiling entry dropped from both, so a module is silently no
#     longer covered;
#   * an entry point dropped entirely, same effect, no trace.
#
# Separately, an adoption of the shared body onto capa_base64 performed
# exactly as the checklist instructs produced 52 green assertions on a
# repository still declaring `capa = ">=1.1.0"`, a floor that CANNOT
# build the package at all.
#
# A guard nobody has ever seen fail is a guard nobody has evidence
# about. So each mutation below is applied to a scratch copy of this
# repository, the relevant test is run there, and it is required to
# FAIL. The unmutated control is required to PASS, which is what rules
# out the harness reporting success because the test errored for its own
# reasons.
#
# MUTATIONS S THROUGH Y TARGET A DIFFERENT CHECK. Everything up to R
# mutates what this repository DECLARES about itself, and the wiring
# test catches it. S onwards mutates the ~770 lines of shared body that
# were COPIED into this repository from the compiler's templates, which
# the wiring test cannot see, because it is the file being edited. Those
# run tests/test_shared_regions.sh instead. W is the odd one out and
# must stay GREEN: it edits the config region, which is repo-specific by
# design, and a drift check that reddens there is one that gets turned
# off. X is the one that matters most, and the reason the drift check is
# not a digest alone: the config region is not digested, so a single
# line of shell placed in it can neutralise the whole file while the
# digest reports no drift.
#
# Run it directly:
#
#   bash tests/test_wiring_mutations.sh
#
# `capa test` runs the .capa files in tests/ and ignores this one.
