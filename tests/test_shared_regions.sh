# DRIFT CHECK FOR THE FLEET'S COPIED TEST FILES.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. tests/test_release_wiring.sh and
# tests/test_wiring_mutations.sh are ~1300 lines of security-checking
# logic that is COPIED into every repository that adopts the shared
# release guards. Copies drift, and a drifted copy still reports
# success. That is not a hypothetical: a capability tuple hand-copied at
# 21 sites in the compiler had already drifted before anyone looked, and
# capa_authgate's check_tag_version.sh became a second copy whose two
# versions immediately printed different messages while looking
# interchangeable.
#
# TWO KINDS OF ENTRY, because the fleet's copied files are of two kinds.
#
#   REGION. tests/test_release_wiring.sh and
#   tests/test_wiring_mutations.sh must say repo-specific things, so
#   each is split by two marker lines into a CONFIG region, which is
#   repo-specific by design, and everything else, which is meant to be
#   byte-identical across the fleet. Only the part outside the markers
#   is digested, and the config region is checked separately by grammar.
#
#   WHOLE. tests/test_shared_regions.sh (this file),
#   tests/test_guard_pins.sh and .github/workflows/checks.yml have NO
#   repo-specific content at all, so the whole file is digested and
#   there is no config region, no markers, no marker-shape failure
#   modes, no grammar and no allowlist.
#
# THE SECOND KIND IS NOT A CONVENIENCE. The config region is the only
# part of a shared file that nothing digests, which makes it the
# un-digested attack surface (see the grammar note below for what one
# line placed there can do). A file that has no config region has none
# of that surface. Giving one to a zero-config file, to carry some
# future flag used in one repository out of twenty-two, would
# manufacture exactly the bypass class the grammar below exists to
# police. Zero-config files stay whole-file entries.
#
# THIS FILE IS ITSELF A WHOLE-FILE ENTRY, which is the point. Before it
# was, it policed the other files and nothing policed it: deleting one
# row from the SHARED_FILES table below removed a file from the check
# entirely, and both this check and the wiring test then reported
# success with the release gate gone. Measured on a scratch copy of a
# real adopter, before the change:
#
#   delete the wiring-test row, then neutralise the wiring test
#     drift check : exit=0   FAILs=0
#     wiring test : exit=0
#
# A self-digesting check would not have closed that, since whoever
# edits the table can regenerate the number. Layer 2 does close it,
# because the number it compares against is UPSTREAM's.
#
# THE MARKERS ARE INSIDE THE DIGESTED REGION, for region entries. That
# is deliberate. If they were outside it, the marker text itself could
# be edited to move the boundary and enlarge the un-digested region,
# which is the same defect one level up.
#
# WHY THE CONFIG REGION IS ALSO GRAMMAR-CHECKED, which is the part that
# is easy to leave out and is the reason this file was rewritten. A
# digest over everything-but-the-config says nothing about the config,
# and the config is shell that the file SOURCES. Measured on a scratch
# copy of a real adopter:
#
#   baseline                            53 passed, 0 failed    EXIT=0
#   delete `needs: guards`              FAIL ...  1 failed     EXIT=1
#   + `trap 'exit 0' EXIT` in CONFIG    FAIL ...  1 failed     EXIT=0
#
# The release gate is gone, the failure is still printed, CI is green
# because the exit status is 0, and a digest-only drift check reports no
# drift because the shared region did not change. So the config region
# is required to consist of nothing but blank lines, comments, and one
# single-line assignment to each of an ALLOWLIST of names. Anything else
# is refused, including a trailing comment on an assignment's line.
#
# WHY A TRAILING COMMENT IS REFUSED, stated accurately because the wrong
# reason was recorded here once. It is NOT that recognising one would
# need quote-state tracking; it would not, since every value alternative
# below is self-delimiting and a `#` after one is unambiguous. It is
# that the value of this grammar is that it is small enough to read in
# one sitting and argue about exhaustively. A comment suffix adds a
# second lexical context to every alternative for no gain: no template
# uses one, and an adopter who wants to explain a value has the whole
# rest of the region to do it in.
#
# AND THE WORKFLOW THAT RUNS THEM IS ITSELF AN ENTRY. A drift check
# that nothing executes reports nothing. All of these files once
# appeared in both adopters' YAML only inside comments, so they ran zero
# times per push across a fleet of seventeen repositories.
#
# .github/workflows/checks.yml is therefore a WHOLE-FILE entry too. It
# was briefly left out, on the premise that workflows differ per
# repository so byte-identity would force forks. The fleet had already
# falsified that: the most structurally complex adopter's copy is
# byte-identical to the simplest one's, because every repo-specific fact
# is absorbed by the CONFIG region one layer down and this workflow only
# invokes four fixed script paths. Repositories with extra CI put it in
# a separate workflow, every time. Leaving it out also left a one-line
# bypass, a job-level `if: false`, which every step-level refusal in
# this file missed and which reported 30 passed, 0 failed, EXIT=0.
#
# WHAT NO FILE-BASED MECHANISM CAN COVER, stated plainly rather than
# left for someone to discover: Actions being disabled for the
# repository, branch protection not requiring these checks, and the
# required-check configuration itself. Those live in GitHub settings,
# not in git, so nothing here reaches them and nothing here should be
# read as covering them.
#
# TWO LAYERS, because layer 1 alone is self-certifying:
#
#   1. OFFLINE. Each file's digest is compared to the digest recorded in
#      .github/shared-regions.sha256. This layer NEVER skips. It catches
#      the ordinary case, an edit below the line.
#   2. ONLINE. The canonical file is fetched from the compiler
#      repository at the revision the audit record pins, digested by
#      THIS SAME CODE, and compared to the recorded one. This is what
#      stops someone who edits a body from simply regenerating the
#      number. It reports SKIP without `gh`, matching
#      tests/test_release_wiring.sh: an offline machine cannot answer
#      the question and a test that guesses is the failure mode this
#      whole file is about.
#
# Run it directly:
#
#   bash tests/test_shared_regions.sh
#
# `capa test` runs the .capa files in tests/ and ignores this one.
#
# Set SHARED_REGIONS_SKIP_FETCH=1 to force layer 2 to SKIP.
# tests/test_wiring_mutations.sh does this, because its mutations are
# about layer 1 and a control that reddens because a laptop is offline
# proves nothing about the mutations under it. The variable cannot
# weaken layer 1, which has no network path and no skip branch.
#
# THIS FILE HAS NO REPO-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION. It is copied verbatim
# into every adopter and the fleet's own record covers it, so that
# claim is checked rather than asserted.

# The record parser.
#
# A record line is EXACTLY a 64-character lowercase hex digest, one or
# more spaces or tabs, and a path: nothing before it, nothing after it.
# The regex below is deliberately the same shape
# tests/test_fleet_templates.py enforces in Python
# (`^([0-9a-f]{64})[ \t]+([^ \t]+)$`), because the stated value of
# running two implementations is that they AGREE. They did not: this one
# used to accept trailing junk, leading indentation and trailing
# whitespace that Python rejected, so a malformed record could be read
# two ways by the two halves of one check. Written without an interval
# expression, which not every awk supports, so the 64 is asserted with
# `length` instead.
#
# The first field must BE a digest. Matching on the path alone is not
# enough and was a real defect here: the record's own header contains
# the line `# tests/test_release_wiring.sh and`, whose second field is
# the path, so a path-only lookup returned `#` and reported drift
# against a comment.
#
# `\r` is stripped here too. Without it a CRLF record fails closed with
# "the audit record has no digest for it", which sends a reader looking
# for a missing entry when the entry is present and the line ending is
# the defect. Both current adopters happen to carry `* text eol=lf` in
# .gitattributes; a new one may not, and a diagnostic that names the
# wrong cause is worse than a slower one that names the right one.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The shape is written out literally in both functions rather than

# processes escape sequences in a `-v` assignment, so a regex handed

  # --- is anything actually RUNNING it? ------------------------------
  #
  # Every one of these files is a control whose purpose is noticing
  # silent divergence, and until this assertion existed all four of them
  # appeared in both adopters' YAML only inside comments. They executed
  # zero times per push. A control that runs when a human remembers to
  # run it reports the state of that human's memory.
  #
  # THE PRIMARY ANSWER IS NOW THE DIGEST, not this. .github/workflows/
  # checks.yml is a whole-file entry above, so the workflow that runs
  # these four is compared against the canonical bytes like everything
  # else, and any edit to it reddens.
  #
  # That replaced a weaker design and a false premise. The premise was
  # that "workflows genuinely differ per repository", so demanding
  # byte-identity would force forks. The fleet has falsified it:
  # capa_authgate is exactly the shape predicted to need variation, with
  # five entry points, a negative ceiling entry, a compiler-rejects
  # fixture and nested vendoring, and its checks.yml is byte-identical
  # to a pure library's. That is structural, not luck. Every
  # repo-specific fact is absorbed by the CONFIG region one layer down,
  # and this workflow only ever invokes four fixed script paths. Where
  # repositories DO have extra CI, they put it in a separate workflow,
  # which is what the fleet has actually done every time.
  #
  # And the weaker design leaked. Naming plus the three step-level
  # refusals below missed a one-line job-level disable:
  #
  #   wiring:
  #     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  #     if: false          # 30 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, EXIT=0
  #
  # which is the line a person writes to park a job, so it was the
  # accident case as much as the attack case. The digest catches it.
  #
  # WHY THIS CHECK STAYS ANYWAY, in a smaller role. It is cheap, and it
  # covers two states the digest does not: a repository mid-adoption
  # whose record does not yet carry checks.yml, and a repository that
  # invokes the shared files from some OTHER workflow, which is not
  # digested and never will be. It is no longer the mechanism, and this
  # comment does not present it as one.
  #
  # Comments are stripped first, and NOT only whole-line ones. A
  # trailing `# was: bash tests/test_release_wiring.sh` is exactly what
  # a person writes when temporarily disabling a step, so accepting it
  # reproduces the original defect BY ACCIDENT, which is likelier than
  # anyone attacking this.
  #
  # The result is captured rather than tested with `grep -q`. `pipefail`
  # is set, and `grep -q` exits at the first match and closes the pipe,
