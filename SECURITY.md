# Security

## Scope of this library

`capa_validate` performs **structural input validation**: shape-level
checks over untrusted strings and integers to catch malformed input
early. These are **not security guarantees** and **not authoritative
parsers**. In particular, `looks_like_email` and `looks_like_url` are
loose **heuristics** over the shape of the text; passing one does not
prove the address is real or deliverable, or that the URL resolves or is
safe to fetch. Their whitespace check rejects only the four ASCII
whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, carriage return); it does
**not** reject other ASCII control characters or an embedded NUL, so a
value that passes is not guaranteed to be printable. See the README's
"Honest posture" before relying on any of these for a trust decision.

## Verifying the signature of a release

Published release tags are GPG-signed. The publisher's key:

- **Name**: Nelson Duarte (capa-language publisher)
- **Email**: nelson.duarte31@gmail.com
- **Fingerprint**:
  `6C1D 222D 491F B880 31E0  41A5 36CF B426 101A A24B`
- **Public key**: [`publisher.asc`](./publisher.asc) in this
  repository.

The full 40-character fingerprint without spaces:
`6C1D222D491FB88031E041A536CFB426101AA24B`. Use this exact
form in your `capa.toml`'s `verify_key` field (spaces and
colons are also accepted; the manifest parser normalises).

### Import the key

Out-of-band trust path (recommended): clone this repository,
inspect `publisher.asc`, then:

```bash
gpg --import publisher.asc
gpg --fingerprint nelson.duarte31@gmail.com
# Verify the printed fingerprint matches the one above.
```

Or fetch from a keyserver (less trustworthy; verify the
fingerprint independently):

```bash
gpg --recv-keys 6C1D222D491FB88031E041A536CFB426101AA24B
```

### Verify a tag manually

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nelsonduarte/capa_validate
cd capa_validate
git verify-tag v0.1.0
# Look for: "Good signature from "Nelson Duarte <...>" [ultimate]"
# and the fingerprint above.
```

### Verify automatically via `capa install`

Declare the fingerprint in your project's `capa.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.capa_validate]
git = "https://github.com/nelsonduarte/capa_validate"
tag = "v0.1.0"
verify_key = "6C1D222D491FB88031E041A536CFB426101AA24B"
```

`capa install` runs `git verify-tag` against your keyring and
refuses to install when the signature is absent, invalid, or
from a different key. Details:
[docs/packages.md in the main Capa repo](https://github.com/nelsonduarte/capa-language/blob/main/docs/packages.md#sources-in-detail).
